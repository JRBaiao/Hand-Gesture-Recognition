## Overview

This project is a **Hand Gesture Recognition System** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**. The goal is to detect and classify hand gestures in real time using a webcam, enabling gesture-based interaction for applications such as virtual controls, sign language recognition, and more.

The system processes hand landmarks and recognizes custom gestures based on predefined models or logic.

## Features

- 🤚 Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe  
- 🧠 Gesture classification using keypoints and point history  
- 🎯 Supports dynamic and static gestures  
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight — runs on most machines with a webcam  
- 🖥️ Console-based or GUI-friendly structure (easily extendable)

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn (for gesture classification, optional)

## How It Works

1. Uses MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks in video frames.  
2. Extracts keypoint data and (optionally) tracks point history.  
3. Feeds this data into a classification model to identify specific gestures.  
4. Displays the detected gesture on screen in real time.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hand-Gesture-Recognition.git
   cd Hand-Gesture-Recognition
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy scikit-learn
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python gesture_recognition.py
   ```

4. Show your hand to the webcam and see the detected gesture displayed on screen!

## Example Use Cases

- 🔢 Control interfaces with hand signs (e.g., thumbs up, victory sign)  
- 🔠 Sign language interpretation  
- 🎮 Game control using hand gestures  
- 🧪 Human-computer interaction (HCI) demos

## Future Enhancements

- Add GUI interface (Tkinter, PyQt)  
- Train and include more custom gestures  
- Integrate audio feedback or system actions  
- Improve gesture accuracy with deep learning models (e.g., CNN, RNN)
